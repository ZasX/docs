# Migrating

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Goal

A safe migration of an existing app to a new app, while still having the old app available. So if something goes wrong, you haven't lost the old app.

## Create new app with a different name

In this guide, I'll be using the app `vaultwarden` as an example. I chose the name `testwarden` for the new app install.

I installed the new app with mostly default settings, just changed service type to `ClusterIP` and setup a new, temporary, ingress.

## Configure database connections in pgadmin

run the tcdbinfo.sh script to see the connection details for both the old and the new database, and set them up in pgadmin.

## Scale down both apps

```bash
k3s kubectl get deploy -n ix-<appname>
```

```bash
k3s kubectl scale deploy testwarden-vaultwarden -n ix-testwarden --replicas=0
k3s kubectl scale deploy vaultwarden -n ix-vaultwarden --replicas=0
```

## Postgres databases
<details>
  <summary>Database management</summary>
  <div>
    <div>This is the detailed content</div>
    <br/>
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="prerequisits" label="Prerequisits" default>
        Make sure you have `pgadmin` installed, as we'll be using it to make a backup and to restore the database. It's a TrueCharts app from the stable train. You can install it with all default settings, and it will work.

        Also make sure you have the database info script (`tcdbinfo.sh`) available on your server.
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">
        This is an orange üçä
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">
        This is a banana üçå
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</details>
### Create database backup

In `pgadmin`, right click `vaultwarden->Databases->vaultwarden` and click `Backup...`. Give the file a name (e.g. `vaultwarden.sql`) and click `Backup`.

### Restore database backup

In `pgadmin`, right click `testwarden->Databases->vaultwarden` and click `Restore...`. Select the sql file (`vaultwarden.sql`).

On the 2nd tab page, select the first 3 options (`Pre-data`, `Data` and `Post-data`). On the last tab, select `Clean before restore`. Now click `Restore`.

## Migrate the PVC

The following command will return the data PVC's for the old and the new install

```bash
k3s kubectl get pvc -A | grep warden-data | sort -u | awk '{print $1, $2, $4}' | column -t
zfs list | grep warden | grep legacy
```

Destroy the PVC of the new app and replicate the PVC of the old app to the new location.

```bash
zfs destroy new-pvc
zfs snapshot old-pvc@migrate
zfs send old-pvc@migrate | zfs recv new-pvc@migrate
zfs set mountpoint=legacy new-pvc
```

The `new-pvc` will look something like `poolname/ix-applications/releases/testwarden/volumes/pvc-32341f93-0647-4bf9-aab1-e09b3ebbd2b3`.

The `old-pvc` will look something like `poolname/ix-applications/releases/vaultwarden/volumes/pvc-40275e0e-5f99-4052-96f1-63e26be01236`.

## Scale up both apps

```bash
k3s kubectl scale deploy testwarden-vaultwarden -n ix-testwarden --replicas=1
k3s kubectl scale deploy vaultwarden -n ix-vaultwarden --replicas=1
```

## Reflection

You should now be able to log in on the new install.
